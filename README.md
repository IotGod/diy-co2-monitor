# DIY, low cost esp-platform based CO2 monitor ;-) 

> **This project is under development!!!** \
> **Current release should work for real-time CO2 monitoring 'out-of-the-box'.**

This repository contains the firmware source code for a low-cost CO2 monitor built using [platform.io](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.html) framework, and standard ESP modules such Wemos Lolin32 and clones.

Current hardware setup, includes support for (total cost about 22â‚¬):
- Wemos Lolin32 OLED Board and clones (ESP-WROOM-32).
- MH-Z19B CO2 Sensor (0-5000ppm +/-50ppm range).

## **Sensor wiring**
As the ESP module is able to run supplied from standard USB Smartphone charger, it is only need to wire 4 cables between ESP module and MH-Z19B Sensor:
